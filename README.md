# AWS Terraform Labs

Public AWS and Terraform learning repo with small labs focused on one concept at a time—like S3, IAM, Lambda, EC2, VPC, ECS, RDS, and EventBridge.

Most labs are designed for local Floci. A few were only verified in AWS where local support was missing.

## Topics covered

AWS, Terraform, Infrastructure as Code, DevOps, cloud engineering, S3, IAM, Lambda, EC2, VPC, ALB, ECS, Step Functions, CloudFront, EventBridge, RDS, CloudWatch, GitHub Actions OIDC, and SQS.

## Repo structure

```text
projects/
  <lab-name>/
    README.md
    terraform/
tools/
  tf.sh
```

Each lab has:
- a short `README.md`
- Terraform in `terraform/`

## Prerequisites

- `floci`
- `terraform`
- `direnv`
- `awscli`
- `python3`
- `node`

## Start Floci

```sh
floci start
direnv allow
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

Expected local values:
- Account: `000000000000`
- Arn: `arn:aws:iam::000000000000:root`
- Endpoint: `http://localhost.floci.io:4566`

## Run a Terraform lab

```sh
cd projects/01-s3-basics
../../tools/tf.sh init
../../tools/tf.sh plan
../../tools/tf.sh apply
../../tools/tf.sh destroy
```

`tools/tf.sh` expects to run from a lab directory or its `terraform/` subdirectory.

## Notes

- Local Floci behavior can differ from AWS.
- Review IAM, networking, and cost before pointing any lab at real AWS.
- CI only runs static Terraform checks. It does not prove end-to-end runtime behavior.
